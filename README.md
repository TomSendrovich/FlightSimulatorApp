# FlightSimulatorApp
WPF application using MVVM architecture. Convenient UI to control an aircraft simulator.

### Simple interface for controlling flight simulator
Our app will open a dedicated communication channel with the simulator, where we will pass commands to change the status of the rudders,
or to receive information from the sensors installed on the aircraft.
